This instance has successfully:
        Create an interpreter
        Determine the amount of RAM used by the model : "328224 bytes"
        Pass the first invoke 

This is done by using :
     the model "my_EEGnet_ogA_1_h5_tflite", which is:
        butchered
        NOT quantised
    and 
    the lib "tflm-tree-_mkfl_pytr"

To be completed:
        Read incoming data and feed to the input tensor(?)
        Verify the accuracy of the model against the tensorflow model and the OG model
        Record the speed
